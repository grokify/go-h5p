## Community Priorities

Based on community feedback, we'll prioritize:

1. **More Content Types** - Expanding beyond MultiChoice
2. **Better Documentation** - More examples and tutorials
3. **Integration Guides** - Platform-specific integration help
4. **Performance** - Faster content processing
5. **Testing Tools** - Better validation and testing utilities

## How to Contribute

### High Impact Areas
- **Content Type Implementation** - Add support for new H5P content types
- **Validation Improvements** - Enhance content validation
- **Documentation** - Create tutorials and examples
- **Testing** - Improve test coverage and quality

### Getting Started
1. Check the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md) for setup instructions
2. Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`
3. Join discussions on content type priorities
4. Submit bug reports and feature requests

### Requesting Features

When requesting features:
1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Provide use cases** explaining why the feature is needed  
3. **Include examples** of how the feature would be used
4. **Consider implementation** - think about how it might work

Example feature request:
```markdown
## Feature Request: Interactive Timeline Support

### Use Case
Educational content creators need to present historical events 
in an interactive timeline format.

### Proposed Solution  
Add support for H5P.Timeline content type with:
- Event plotting on timeline
- Rich media for each event
- Zoom and navigation controls

### Additional Context
Timeline is one of the most requested content types in 
H5P community forums.
```

## Technology Considerations

### Go Ecosystem
- **Modules** - Maintain Go module compatibility
- **Generics** - Evaluate using Go generics for type safety
- **Performance** - Leverage Go's concurrency features
- **Testing** - Use Go's excellent testing framework

### H5P Compatibility
- **Specification compliance** - Follow official H5P specs
- **Version compatibility** - Support multiple H5P versions
- **Platform testing** - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- **Standards adherence** - Follow web standards and accessibility

### Development Process
- **Semantic versioning** - Predictable version releases
- **Backward compatibility** - Minimize breaking changes
- **Documentation-driven** - Document before implementing
- **Test-driven development** - Tests first, then implementation

## Release Schedule

### Minor Releases (Monthly)
- Bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements

### Major Releases (Quarterly)
